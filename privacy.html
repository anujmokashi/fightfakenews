    <h1 class="privacy-heading">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="privacy-content">
      <p class="text-justify">
        This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Website Operator ("Website
        Operator", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the
        personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you
        ("User", "you" or "your") may provide on the fightfakenews.live website
        and any of its products or services (collectively, "Website" or
        "Services").
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your
        Personal Information and how you can access and update this information.
        This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not
        own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
      </p>

      <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the
        no logs policy. We process only minimal user data, only as much as it is
        absolutely necessary to maintain the Website or Services. Information
        collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of
        abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage.
        This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way
        that would identify any particular user of the system.
      </p>

      <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing
        any information by which someone could identify you as a specific,
        identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
        Website's features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal
        Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and
        store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any
        online forms on the Website. You can choose not to provide us with your
        Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
        some of the Website's features. Users who are uncertain about what
        information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
      </p>

      <h2>Storing personal information</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
        necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
        enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or
        permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or
        incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it,
        but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the
        retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.
        Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
        rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
        the expiration of the retention period.
      </p>

      <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a
        legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal
        Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
        may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services.
        Some of the information we collect is directly from you via our Website.
        However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other
        sources. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to help
        us run and operate our Website and Services.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
        our Website, where you are located in the world and if one of the
        following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more
        specific purposes. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
        processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer
        Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) Provision of
        information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you
        and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is
        necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
        subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
        public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;
        (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
        pursued by us or by a third party.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
        information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without
        having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases
        below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis
        that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision
        of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
        requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
      </p>

      <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and
        storing your information in a country other than your own. You are
        entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a
        country outside the European Union or to any international organization
        governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries,
        such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard
        your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out
        more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with
        us using the information provided in the contact section.
      </p>

      <h2>The rights of users</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by
        us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have
        the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your
        consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right
        to object to the processing of your information if the processing is
        carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the
        right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain
        disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy
        of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
        verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or
        corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to
        restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not
        process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you
        have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of
        your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive
        your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable
        format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
        controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided
        that your information is processed by automated means and that the
        processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of
        or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
      </p>

      <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the
        exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of
        the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
        processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to
        justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal
        Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object
        to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To
        learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct
        marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this
        document.
      </p>

      <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to Website Operator
        through the contact details provided in this document. These requests
        can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by Website
        Operator as early as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>California privacy rights</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        In addition to the rights as explained in this Privacy Policy,
        California residents who provide Personal Information (as defined in the
        statute) to obtain products or services for personal, family, or
        household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a
        calendar year, information about the Personal Information we shared, if
        any, with other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable, this
        information would include the categories of Personal Information and the
        names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such
        personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g.,
        requests made in the current year will receive information about the
        prior year). To obtain this information please contact us.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under
        the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any
        Personal Information through our Website or Service. We encourage
        parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage
        and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to
        provide Personal Information through our Website or Service without
        their permission.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has
        provided Personal Information to us through our Website or Service,
        please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent
        to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some
        countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
      </p>

      <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
        websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
        tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
        connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
        collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or
        visit a website or online service as they move across different websites
        over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
        uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to interpret or
        respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so,
        as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and
        collection of your personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or
        controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
        privacy practices of such other websites or third-parties. We encourage
        you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy
        statements of each and every website that may collect Personal
        Information.
